# poetrypark.club-archive

This is an archive of PoetryPark.club source code. This project was never published and is one of my first attempts at building a fully functional website that relied heavily on backend development. The website is based on PHP and uses MySQL as a database management system.



## The aim of the peoject

The original aim of the project is to built a website for writers and poets to share their work on (hend the name Poetry Park) and for me to experiment with web development and design while also blending it with my other interest which is writing and poetry.



## Results of the project

Al though the project never saw the light of the day, it taught me a lot about web development and design. By building this website I've learned many skills that are essential to web development such as project managment and planning.



## Licensing and the future

The code is published to be put on my portfolio and it won't be recieving updates or will be published. You can look through the code which could help some people since the code is built in a simple manner.

Licensing information is available in the `LICENSE` file.
